    ```

## Environment Variables

You'll need to create two `.env` files for this project.

1.  **Backend `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory and add the following variables:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    PORT=5000
    ```

2.  **Frontend `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    From the `backend/` directory, run:

    ```sh
    npm start

    From the root directory, run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

This application is designed for easy deployment on modern hosting platforms.

- **Frontend**: Can be deployed to static hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
